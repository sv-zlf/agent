Executes shell commands and returns the output. Use this tool ONLY when specialized tools are insufficient.

Allowed Use Cases:
- Running tests (npm test, pytest, etc.)
- Building projects (npm run build, make, etc.)
- Git operations (git status, git commit, git push, etc.)
- Installing dependencies (npm install, pip install, etc.)
- Executing project-specific scripts
- Operations that cannot be completed with other tools

NOT Recommended For:
- Searching for files - Use Glob tool instead
- Searching file contents - Use Grep tool instead
- Reading files - Use Read tool instead
- Listing directory contents - Use Glob tool instead

Usage:
- The command parameter is the shell command to execute
- Commands are executed in the current working directory
- Command output (stdout and stderr) is returned
- Command execution is limited to 30 seconds by default

Recommendations:
- Use this tool sparingly and only when absolutely necessary
- Prefer specialized tools (Glob, Grep, Read) for file operations
- Test your commands locally before using them in the tool
- Be aware that commands are platform-dependent (Windows vs Linux/macOS)
- For complex operations, consider breaking them into multiple simpler commands

Performs multiple edit operations on a single file. All edits are executed sequentially as atomic operations.

**Usage:**
- All edits are applied sequentially in the order they appear
- If any edit fails, all changes are rolled back and the file is not modified
- For creating new files, use empty oldString
- Maximum 50 edit operations allowed per call

**Format:**
```json
{
  "tool": "multiedit",
  "parameters": {
    "file_path": "H:/Project/agent/src/utils/config.ts",
    "edits": [
      {
        "oldString": "export const API_URL = 'old'",
        "newString": "export const API_URL = 'new'"
      },
      {
        "oldString": "export const TIMEOUT = 5000",
        "newString": "export const TIMEOUT = 10000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**
- filePath (required): The absolute path to the file
- edits (required): List of edit operations
  - oldString (required): The string to replace
  - newString (required): The replacement string
  - replaceAll (optional): Replace all occurrences (default: false)

**Recommendations:**
- Use MultiEdit when you need to make multiple related changes to a file
- Break large refactorings into multiple MultiEdit calls if needed
- Test oldStrings carefully to ensure they match exactly
- Use Read tool first to verify the file content before editing
- For single edits, use Edit tool instead

**exact string matching** is required for each oldString

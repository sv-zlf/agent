Launches a specialized agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks.

**Available Subagent Types:**
- explore - File search specialist for exploring and navigating codebases

**Format:**
```json
{
  "tool": "task",
  "parameters": {
    "subagent_type": "explore",
    "description": "Find auth-related files",
    "prompt": "Find all files related to authentication in the codebase. Look for files containing 'auth', 'login', 'password', 'token'. Report the file paths found."
  }
}
```

**When to Use Task Tool:**
- When you need to rapidly explore a codebase
- When searching for specific file patterns or code content
- For tasks requiring broad codebase navigation
- When the main context is too large and you need a focused exploration

**When NOT to Use Task Tool:**
- To read specific files - Use Read tool directly
- To search specific class definitions - Use Glob tool directly
- To search 2-3 specific files for code - Use Read tool directly

**Parameters:**
- subagent_type (required): The specialized agent type to use
- description (required): A brief task description (3-5 words)
- prompt (required): The specific task for the agent to execute

**Recommendations:**
- Be specific and clear in your task description
- Provide detailed instructions in the prompt
- Use the explore agent for codebase exploration and file/content searches

      },
      {

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

  - content (required): Task description
  - status (optional): Task status - 'pending', 'in_progress', or 'completed'
  - id (optional): Task identifier

**Usage:**
- Use TodoWrite at the beginning of complex tasks to break them down
- Update tasks as you complete them by setting status
- Use TodoRead to check remaining tasks
- Use TodoDelete to remove individual tasks
- Use TodoClear to reset the task list when starting a new task
- Tasks are persisted to ~/.ggcode/todos.json and survive across sessions

**Recommendations:**
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Update task status as you progress through the work
- Use descriptive task names that clearly indicate what needs to be done
- Review the task list regularly to stay on track

Executes multiple tool calls in parallel, significantly improving efficiency for independent operations.

**Usage:**
- Use when you need to execute multiple independent operations
- All tool calls are executed in parallel (up to 25 at once)
- Returns aggregated results with success/failure counts
- Nested batch calls are not allowed

**Format:**
```json
{
  "tool": "batch",
  "parameters": {
    "tool_calls": [
      {
        "tool": "read",
        "parameters": {
          "file_path": "H:/Project/agent/src/app.ts"
        }
      },
      {
        "tool": "read",
        "parameters": {
          "file_path": "H:/Project/agent/src/utils.ts"
        }
      },
      {
        "tool": "grep",
        "parameters": {
          "pattern": "interface User",
          "path": "H:/Project/agent/src"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**tool_calls** parameter is required - array of tool calls to execute in parallel

**Recommendations:**
- Batch independent operations together for better performance
- Group related file reads or searches
- Do not use Batch for sequential operations
- Check results to identify which operations succeeded or failed
- Use Batch to reduce round-trip time when multiple tools need to be called

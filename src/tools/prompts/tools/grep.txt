Searches file contents using regex patterns. This is the fastest way to find code or text within files.

Usage:
- The pattern parameter specifies the regex pattern to search for
- The path parameter specifies the root directory for the search (defaults to current working directory if not specified)
- Searches are case-insensitive
- Returns matching lines with file paths and line numbers

Regex Examples:
- `function getUserById` - Find function definitions
- `import.*from.*react` - Find React imports
- `TODO|FIXME` - Find todo comments
- `class.*extends.*Component` - Find class definitions
- `async.*function` - Find async function declarations

Recommendations:
- Use Grep for searching file contents with regex patterns
- Prefer Grep over Bash's grep command for better performance and cross-platform compatibility
- Combine with Glob tool for efficient codebase exploration (Glob to find files, then Grep to search contents)
- Use simple, specific patterns for better results
- Test your regex patterns incrementally if you're not getting expected results

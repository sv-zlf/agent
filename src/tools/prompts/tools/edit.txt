Performs precise string replacement within a file. You MUST read the file content before using this tool.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path
- The oldString parameter must match the file content exactly, including indentation and newlines
- The newString parameter contains the replacement content
- If oldString appears multiple times and replaceAll is false, the edit will fail
- The replaceAll parameter replaces all occurrences when set to true

Important Notes:
- This tool performs exact string matching - case-sensitive, including all whitespace
- If the edit fails with "oldString not found in content", the oldString may not match exactly
- For multi-line replacements, ensure the oldString includes proper line endings
- Always use the Read tool first to see the exact content before editing

Recommendations:
- Use Edit tool for small, targeted changes
- For large file rewrites, use Write tool instead
- Test your oldString by searching for unique identifiers in the file
- If oldString contains special characters, consider escaping them

## bash

Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session.

**Usage:**
- Running tests (npm test, pytest, etc.)
- Building projects (npm run build, make, etc.)
- Git operations (git status, git commit, git push)
- Installing dependencies (npm install, pip install)
- Operations that cannot be completed with other tools

**When NOT to use:**
- Searching files → use `glob`
- Searching content → use `grep`
- Reading files → use `read`
- Editing files → use `edit`

**Parameters:**
- `command` (required): Shell command to execute
- `workdir` (optional): Working directory for command execution
- `timeout` (optional): Timeout in milliseconds (default: 120000)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "bash",
  "parameters": {
    "command": "npm test",
    "workdir": "H:/Project/agent"
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Prefer specialized tools over bash when possible
- Commands are platform-dependent (Windows vs Linux/macOS)
- Quote file paths that contain spaces
- Break complex operations into multiple simpler commands

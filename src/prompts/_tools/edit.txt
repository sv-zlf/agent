## edit

Performs precise string replacement in a file. Use for single edits to a single file.

**Usage:**
- Editing ONE location in ONE file
- Making precise string replacements

**When NOT to use:**
- Multiple edits to the same file → use `multiedit`
- Creating new files → use `write`

**Parameters:**
- `filePath` (required): Absolute path to the file
- `oldString` (required): Exact text to replace (must match file content exactly)
- `newString` (required): New text to insert

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "edit",
  "parameters": {
    "filePath": "H:/Project/agent/src/config.ts",
    "oldString": "const VERSION = '1.0.0';",
    "newString": "const VERSION = '2.0.0';"
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- `oldString` must match file content exactly (including whitespace)
- Always read the file first to get the exact content
- Use `multiedit` for multiple changes to the same file

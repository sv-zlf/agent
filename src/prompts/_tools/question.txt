- Offering choices to the user

**Parameters:**

  - `header` (required): Very short label (max 30 chars)
  - `question` (required): Complete question text
  - `options` (required): Array of choices
    - `label` (required): Display text (1-5 words)
    - `description` (required): Explanation of choice
  - `multiple` (optional): Allow selecting multiple choices (default: false)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "question",
  "parameters": {
    "questions": [
      {
        "header": "Framework",
        "question": "Which framework would you like to use?",
        "options": [
          {
            "label": "React",
            "description": "Popular UI library with component-based architecture"
          },
          {
            "label": "Vue",
            "description": "Progressive framework with gentle learning curve"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

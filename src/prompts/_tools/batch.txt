## batch

Executes multiple tool calls in parallel, significantly improving efficiency.

**When to use:**
- Multiple independent operations
- Parallel file reads or searches
- Reducing round-trip time

**When NOT to use:**
- Sequential operations with dependencies
- Nested batch calls (not allowed)

**Parameters:**
- `tool_calls` (required): Array of tool call objects

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "batch",
  "parameters": {
    "tool_calls": [
      {
        "tool": "read",
        "parameters": {
          "filePath": "H:/Project/agent/src/app.ts"
        }
      },
      {
        "tool": "read",
        "parameters": {
          "filePath": "H:/Project/agent/src/utils.ts"
        }
      },
      {
        "tool": "grep",
        "parameters": {
          "pattern": "interface User",
          "path": "H:/Project/agent/src"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Batch independent operations together
- Group related file reads or searches
- Do not use Batch for sequential operations
- Check results to identify success/failure
- Up to 25 tool calls can be batched at once

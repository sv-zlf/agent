Analyze the current codebase and create/update AGENTS.md file with the following content:

## Required Content

1. **Project Overview**
   - Extract project name and description from README.md
   - Explain main functionality and tech stack

2. **Build and Test Commands**
   - Extract available npm scripts from package.json
   - Focus on:
     - How to run individual tests
     - How to build the project
     - How to run linter
     - How to start dev server

3. **Code Style Guide**
   - Import order (built-in, 3rd party, internal modules)
   - Naming conventions (files, classes, functions, variables, constants)
   - TypeScript type usage standards
   - Error handling patterns
   - Comment and documentation standards

4. **Project Structure**
   - Purpose of main directories and files
   - Responsibilities of key modules

5. **Development Workflow**
   - Daily development process
   - Code review standards
   - Commit conventions

## Additional Sources

If these files exist, integrate their content into AGENTS.md:
- `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules` (Cursor IDE rules)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (GitHub Copilot instructions)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Contributing guidelines)
- Existing `AGENTS.md` (improve it)

## Output Requirements

1. Document length: ~150-200 lines
2. Use clear Markdown format
3. Include specific code examples
4. Use tables for naming conventions
5. Highlight important info (commands, notes)

## Notes

- Generated document will be used by AI coding assistants
- Ensure information is accurate, concise, easy to understand
- Prioritize practicality over completeness
- Use reasonable defaults if information is missing

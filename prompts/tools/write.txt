Creates a new file or completely overwrites the existing file content.
The tool automatically creates any necessary parent directories.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path
- If the file already exists, it will be completely overwritten
- You MUST read the file content with the Read tool BEFORE writing to an existing file
- Prioritize editing existing files over creating new files

Recommendations:
- Always use Read tool first to check if a file exists before writing
- For small changes, use the Edit tool instead of Write tool
- Do not create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested
- The content parameter should contain the complete file content, not just a fragment

Executes multiple tool calls in parallel, significantly improving efficiency for independent operations.

Parameters:
- tool_calls (array, required): List of tool calls to execute
  - tool (string, required): Tool name
  - parameters (object, required): Tool parameters

Usage:
- Use this tool when you need to execute multiple independent operations
- All tool calls are executed in parallel (up to 25 at once)
- Returns aggregated results with success/failure counts
- Nested batch calls are not allowed

Recommendations:
- Batch independent operations together for better performance
- Group related file reads or searches
- Do not use Batch for sequential operations (execute them one by one instead)
- Check results to identify which operations succeeded or failed
- Use Batch to reduce round-trip time when multiple tools need to be called

Example:
```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    { "tool": "read", "parameters": { "filePath": "/src/app.ts" } },
    { "tool": "read", "parameters": { "filePath": "/src/utils.ts" } },
    { "tool": "grep", "parameters": { "pattern": "interface User", "path": "/src" } }
  ]
}
```

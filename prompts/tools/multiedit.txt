Performs multiple edit operations on a single file. All edits are executed sequentially as atomic operations.

Parameters:
- filePath (string, required): The absolute path to the file
- edits (array, required): List of edit operations
  - oldString (string, required): The string to replace
  - newString (string, required): The replacement string
  - replaceAll (boolean, optional): Replace all occurrences (default: false)

Usage:
- All edits are applied sequentially in the order they appear in the array
- If any edit fails, all changes are rolled back and the file is not modified
- For creating new files, use empty oldString
- Maximum 50 edit operations allowed per call

Recommendations:
- Use MultiEdit when you need to make multiple related changes to a file
- Break large refactorings into multiple MultiEdit calls if needed
- Test your oldStrings carefully to ensure they match exactly
- Use the Read tool first to verify the file content before editing
- For single edits, use the Edit tool instead

Example:
```json
{
  "filePath": "/src/utils/config.ts",
  "edits": [
    { "oldString": "export const API_URL = 'old'", "newString": "export const API_URL = 'new'" },
    { "oldString": "export const TIMEOUT = 5000", "newString": "export const TIMEOUT = 10000" }
  ]
}
```

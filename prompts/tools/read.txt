Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit, which is especially handy for long files
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned with line numbers starting at 1
- You can read image files using this tool (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, etc.)
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response - it is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch

Recommendations:
- Read multiple relevant files in one tool call whenever possible
- For exploring unknown codebases, start with package.json, README.md, or entry point files
- If you need to read a specific part of a large file, use offset and limit parameters
